Overview of Data and Key Interpretations
The two sets of data on approval trends for major presidential contenders during the 19th and 20th South Korean presidential elections were derived from refined CSV files. 
In the datasets, the variable labeled “consideration” reflects the public perception of each figure’s suitability as a presidential candidate, allowing us to interpret how leadership potential is perceived.

From this data, one key conclusion becomes apparent: 
  a politician's personal network within the political sphere matters less than their ability to appeal directly to the public. 
  The two documents linked above provide insight into what aspects contribute to this public appeal—such as administrative experience, consistency in political beliefs, and media exposure.

On Party Approval Ratings and Public Opinion Polls
The third dataset, which tracks changes in political party approval ratings over time, plays a critical role in evaluating the credibility and bias of public opinion surveys.

Our findings suggest the following:
The popularity of major progressive and conservative parties varies significantly depending on which polling agency conducted the survey.
This indicates that polling outcomes can differ drastically based on sampling methodology, question framing, and possibly even intentional bias.
Therefore, using public opinion polls to assess the popularity of future presidential candidates must be approached with caution.
In particular, a report by Newstapa (https://www.newstapa.org/article/s6JR1) raised suspicions of manipulation in party primaries, where figures like Myung Tae-kyun allegedly altered poll results to influence candidate selection within the People Power Party. 
This case further supports the argument that poll results are susceptible to manipulation, especially in intra-party contests such as National Assembly primaries.

Distinguishing Poll Use in Presidential Nominee Selection
Despite concerns over manipulation, it is reasonable to expect that the process of selecting a presidential candidate within a major party differs substantially from that of selecting a parliamentary candidate. 
It is unlikely that the outcome of a presidential primary would be determined solely by poll results. 
Instead, factors such as public resonance, charisma, and perceived competence play a much more significant role in determining frontrunners.
While concerns remain regarding polling bias—whether through skewed sampling methods, accidental biases in sample collection, or deliberate manipulation—such concerns may have less impact when it comes to identifying a party’s most viable presidential contender.

Final Interpretation
In this context, using public opinion data to explore the trajectory of support within a single party is less about manipulating public sentiment and more about reflecting it. 
As such, approval trends captured in these datasets can be treated as approximate indicators of a candidate's appeal to party members and the broader electorate.

The public’s preferences in a presidential contender likely reflect factors such as:
  personal integrity and character,
  credibility and feasibility of policies,
  involvement in scandals or legal issues,
  media exposure and relatability.

Hence, we argue that while polling data should not be viewed as absolute truth, it remains a useful proxy for understanding a candidate’s perceived capability and readiness for the presidency.
